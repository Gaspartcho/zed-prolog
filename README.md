# Prolog support for Zed

This extention provides a [Tree-sitter](https://tree-sitter.github.io/tree-sitter/) grammar as well as a [LSP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_Server_Protocol) for the [Prolog](https://www.swi-prolog.org/) language.

## Requirements / Notes

The language server will not work on Windows.

The language server will not work if the path to the file contains a space.
